        <p>Hello! I am Maya Prasad. I am a current Junior at Northeastern Majoring in Data Science and Mathematics. In my free time, I really love to watch sports, go on little adventures in the city, and most of all try new foods. I would like to classify myself as a foodie, someone who likes to try different cuisines and food. I am originally from Ann Arbor, Michigan, which because it is a college town, has really different cuisines and foods that are fun to try. Growing up and having the chance to eat different foods allowed me to both learn about various cultures and immerse myself in newfound favorite meals. After moving to Boston, I have gotten the opportunity to try a whole new set of dishes that I previously would not have had the chance to. I tend to favor foods and cuisines that are on the spicier side, such as Thai or Indian food. However, this doesn't mean I am not open to trying new places and food that I may not have been exposed to. For instance, while in Boston, I had Ghanaian and Peruvian food for the first time. Though I hope to try a lot more while here, especially different restaurants both in the area as well as outside of Boston, I am really happy to have moved to a place that has a diversity in culture and in turn, cuisine, that has allowed me to have these newfound experiences.</p>
