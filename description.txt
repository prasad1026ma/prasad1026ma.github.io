I first used a custom font from Google Fonts, giving it a unique and stylish appearance and set the body text is set to the cursive
'Arima' font, enhancing the overall aesthetic. A light background color (#f8f9fa) is applied to the bofy section for a clean look.
Text Color: The default text color is set to a dark gray (#333), ensuring readability against the light background. The header includes 
a dark green background (#004d00), providing a strong visual element while the header text is set to white for contrast against the dark background.
The header includes padding for spacing, making it visually appealing.
In the above navigation menu it removes default list styles and ensure the links display inline. The navigation links are white, 
maintaining consistency with the header and the links changed to underlined when hovered over. In the main body section
there is a maximum width of 800px and is centered on the page. It includes padding and a white background to separate it from the body background.
Rounded corners and a subtle box shadow give the main area a card-like appearance. Additionally the headings (h1 and h2) are set to white to maintain
visual consistency with the header and footer, although their visibility will depend on the background they are placed on.
Unordered lists have a left padding to indent list items, improving readability.
The footer shares the same dark green background as the header, with white text for uniformity and the links are set to a light color (#f8f9fa), 
ensuring they are visible against the dark footer background. Images within the site are set to have a maximum width of 100% and automatic height adjustment, 
ensuring they are responsive and fit within their containers. Moreover, a class is provided to center-align images, ensuring they are visually appealing within the layout.
Overall, The body has a margin of 15px and padding of 20px, preventing text from touching the sides of the screen and creating a comfortable reading experience.
