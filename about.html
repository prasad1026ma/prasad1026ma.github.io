        <p>Boston, being the large and wonderful city that it is, has access to some of the best chefs and cuisines in the world. From amazing Italian food in the North End to some of the best Thai food I have had in Brookline, Boston has ceased to amaze me in delivering great meals( of course within my college student budget). In my short but great time here, I have been able to explore a lot of the food within the city, ranging from world renowned to hole in the wall locations. Over this time, I started to compile a list of my favorite spots to go eat. There are places I donâ€™t necessarily go to on the regular. Rather, they are both my favorites and best-rated locations.One thing I have struggled with though when eating is with the fact I am vegetarian. Because of this, most of my recommendations tend to be places that are vegan/vegetarian friendly across a wide range of cuisines. As such, this can never be a full comprehensive guide on the best-boston restaurants, due to a large portion of the restaurants, especially in boston, serving dishes with meat/seafood. Despite this, I feel as though I have been able to get a good grasp on the culinary scene here in Boston. </p>

        <h2>My Top 5 Food Recommendations in no order</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kala Thai: A fantastic thai restaraunt in the North End next to the Farmers Market. Has some great food at a really affordable price</li>
            <li>Sumiao: This is sort of a plug because I know the person whose family runs this restaraunt but the variety and options here are amazing(plus the food tastes incredible)</li>
            <li>Tony & Elaine's: The restaraunt itself has a very familalial feel, almost as though you're eating at your grandparents house. The portions are huge and the pasta is very fresh and clean tasting</li>
            <li>Sarma: This is obviosuly an incredibly popular restaraunt, and for good reason. The mezze menu along with the restaraunt aesthetic is amazing, offering a fun place to try a bunch of small mediterranean plates</li>
            <li>Brick Street Bagels: Not necessarily a restaraunt as it is more of a pop-up, but these are some of the best bagels I have ever had. Their rosemary & salt and everything bagels are extremely airy but crisp; exactly the thing to get you in a good mood on the weekend</li>
